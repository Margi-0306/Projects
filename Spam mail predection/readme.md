Spam mail prediction using machine learning with the logistic regression algorithm involves training a model to classify emails as "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). First, the email data is preprocessed and vectorized, turning text into numerical features. The logistic regression model is trained on labeled data, learning to distinguish spam from ham based on patterns. After training, the model predicts whether new emails are spam or not by calculating probabilities and classifying emails with a threshold.

Spam mail prediction using logistic regression involves several key steps:

Data Collection: Gather a labeled dataset of emails, where each email is classified as "spam" or "ham" (not spam). This dataset is essential for training the model.

*Text Preprocessing: Convert the email text into numerical features. This step involves cleaning the data, such as removing stop words, stemming, and transforming words into vectors (e.g., using TF-IDF or bag-of-words techniques).

*Model Training: The logistic regression algorithm is used to model the relationship between the input features (emails) and the target (spam or ham). The model is trained on the labeled data to understand the patterns that differentiate spam from ham.

*Prediction: After training, the model can predict whether a new email is spam based on the features it has learned. Logistic regression uses a probability threshold to classify emails as either spam (1) or ham (0).

*Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which help in determining how well the model predicts spam.
